S,HeckeSearch,"Takes in a HeckeInfo object over a curve C, and fills it with a list of double cosets on C and information about Hecke operators at each place in places. More precisely, Heckesearch keeps a queue of all known double cosets. For each double coset (at index i) in the queue, and each place v, the Hecke neighbors of adelmat at v are computed. They are then tested for isomorphism against all existing double cosets in the queue; if no isomorphisms are found, the neighbor is appended to the end of the queue. A matrix for each place is kept, where the entry at [i,j] is the number of Hecke neighbors from i to j. Optional parameters: - tries (default 5000): the number of pairs (i,v) (as above) to process. Note that if a pair has already been processed and stored in heckeinfo, then it will be skipped. This means that one can run HeckeSearch(heckeinfo, places : tries := 10); repeatedly, and each run will process new information. - status (default 2) : an integer 1 (print i), 2 (print i and v), or 3 (print i, v, and all Hecke neighbors of i). Other parameters are not currently being used and should be left as default",0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,82,,0,0,HeckeInfo,,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
